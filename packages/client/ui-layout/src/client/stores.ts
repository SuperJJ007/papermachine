 * Create the layout panel store handle. The preference IS the width, so

 * default. Actions are the complete write set: drag writes clamp
 * into the panel's contract range and never cross the open/closed line;
 * open/close transitions write 0 / the default explicitly. Below the
 * auto-collapse breakpoint (AppFrame feeds setNarrow) the sidebar toggle
 * flips the narrowExpanded override instead of the preference.
 *
 * Persistence is deliberately asymmetric between the two width fields,
 * against this repo's usual preference for symmetric parallel values:
 * `details` survives a reload, `sidebar` does not (declared `transient`
 * alongside `narrow`/`narrowExpanded`). Details is the workspace surface for
 * documents the user opened on purpose (artifact tabs, project files) and
 * users asked for it to stay open across a reload; the sidebar is
 * navigation chrome, not work state, and `apps/web/tests/smoke-real.e2e.ts`
 * ("sidebar drag widens the column and resets across reload") pins its
 * reset as intentional — persisting it here would fail that coverage.
 * `narrow`/`narrowExpanded` are derived from the live viewport breakpoint
 * (AppFrame's `setNarrow`), never a saved preference: persisting them would
 * let a state captured at a narrow viewport leak into the next load at a
 * wide one.
 * @returns the store handle (spec + type + identity + factory in one).
